<h1>My Favourite Movies/Dramas</h1>
<h2>My Top Movies/Dranas Watched in 2023</h2>

<hr />

<h3>First Love (Netflix)</h3>
<p>Loved how this drama associated messages with colours.<br />
It taught me that your "happiness" depends on how you perceive your situation.<br />
</p>

<h3>Memento</h3>
<p>Loved how it tricks viewers by playing the timeline backwards.<br />
It tells views that people perceive their pasts in their favours.<br />
</p>

<h3>One Piece</h3>
<p>My favourite anime of all-time.</p>
